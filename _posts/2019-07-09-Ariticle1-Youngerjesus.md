Never before has it been such a minor chore to acquire somebody’s key personal details and capitalize on them. 
If your formal government-issued identity is so far unviolated, count yourself lucky— such unfortunate outcomes are only becoming more common.

But some companies are saying enough’s enough, developing blockchain-powered tools to turn the tables in favor of people protecting their identities.

Here are the names to know when it comes to blockchain-powered ways to protect your identity.

Validated ID
    Barcelona-based Validated ID provides digital identity solutions that cater to individuals and businesses working in the remote and eCommerce spaces. 
    We often don’t know for certain that we are dealing with the real somebody when it comes to digital interactions, 
    but Validated ID hopes to remove much of the certainty from virtual dealings. 
    Paperless legal support and identity authentication are among two of Validated ID’s most critical offerings. 

NewBanking
    NewBanking is looking to allow users to prove their identities more easily across the web without sacrificing control over sensitive data

    Users choose precisely which information they want to input into their digital ID, as well as who they choose to share it with. Beyond this,
